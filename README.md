Boggle is a word game designed by Allan Turoff and trademarked by Parker Brothers and Hasbro. The game of Boggle has a dice tray that can hold 16 dice that can be "rolled" to generate a random collection of 16 letters. Each six-sided die has letters on top from which players try to find words. Words are possible if letters line up next to each other horizontally, vertically, or diagonally without being reused. 
There are 3 letters that can be connected to any letter on a corner, 5 for the six letters on the borders, and 8 for the middle four letters. There is no wraparound! To make up one word, no letter may be used more than once. There is no Qu; instead, one die has Q as one of its faces. We will use Q to represent Qu. There is no English word with a Q that is not followed by a U. The following dice tray has the five-letter word QUIET.

  A B C Q  
  T G I X  
  D E H J  
  K L M N
To get points, the word input by the user

Must exist in our official dictionary BoggleWords.txt, 
Must contain 3..16 characters (one and two-letter words do not count for points)
Must not already be counted (no duplicate words allowed)
Proper names may exist in the DiceTray, but are not in our game's "dictionary."
The player's score is determined by summing the points for all words found in a dictionary according to these Boggle rules. There will be no negative points for incorrect attempts entered by the user.
